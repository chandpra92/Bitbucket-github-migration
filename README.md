# Bitbucket-github-migration
Download the bash script list-bitbucket-repositories.sh <br>

 then run it, fill in your username and password (perfectly safe, it just goes to Bitbucketâ€”take a look at the source code, and at our footnote at the end of this article), and save the output to a CSV file, say bb_repositories.csv. You can choose any other name for the output file, of course. <br>
 
 Then execute $ bash list-bitbucket-repositories.sh > bb_repositories.csv
